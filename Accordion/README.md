## ⚡ How it Works
1. Accordion titles have a click event listener attached.  
2. Clicking on a title toggles the `"active"` class:
   - If already open → closes it  
   - If closed → closes any other open sections and opens the clicked one  
3. CSS handles the sliding animation using `max-height` and smooth transitions.
